# Tobamsgroup-assessment
This is my submission for the assessment phase of the application for the position of Front-end Developer.
The application is a react native application that contains an accurate rendering of all UI elements as displayed in the Figma board.

# Functionalities
I also implemented the navigation for the required screens and implemented the basic functionalities for the shop Cart.
You can 'Add to cart', 'Delete from cart' and also increase the quantity of items in the cart.
The basic Cart implementation was setup using React's Contenxt API.

To run the application, simply clone the reopsitory to your local system and run 'expo start' to start the application.
